This project demonstrates how I hosted a **static website** using **Amazon S3**.  
It was part of my cloud journey, where I explored deploying websites in a serverless, scalable way.

## ‚ú® Why This Project?
I wanted to learn how to take a website from my computer and **make it live on the internet** using the cloud.  
Amazon S3 is one of the most reliable and cost-effective ways to do this, and through this project, I gained **hands-on cloud experience**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Bucket Policy
This allows the public to access your website files.  

Here‚Äôs the **bucket policy JSON** I used:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
### 4Ô∏è‚É£.2 Test Bucket Policy with File Deletion
To confirm the policy and permissions were working correctly, I attempted to **delete `index.html`**.  
AWS displayed a warning/confirmation prompt, showing that file deletion has consequences since it is tied to the website endpoint.
