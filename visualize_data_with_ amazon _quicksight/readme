# 📊 Visualize Data with Amazon QuickSight

It’s a full, step-by-step guide — from creating the bucket to troubleshooting issues like the common `403 Forbidden` error.

## ✨ Why This Project?
I wanted to learn how businesses store data in the cloud and transform it into insights with visual dashboards.  
By combining **S3** for storage and **QuickSight** for BI (Business Intelligence), I got hands-on experience with cloud analytics.
